Description: # Fickle: Firewalled Pickle
        
        People abuse pickle. Especially researchers. Pickle is [not secure](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html). Published datasets and ML training weights are often distributed as pickle files (or formats which use pickle files, such as [PyTorch checkpoint.ckpt files](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/saving_loading_models.html)). Sometimes it is the only format that they are available in.
        
        ## Examples
        
        Loading basic types is easy:
        
        ```python
        >>> from fickle import DefaultFirewall
        >>> import pickle
        >>>
        >>> my_picked_data = pickle.dumps({"list": [1, 2, "three", b"four"]})
        >>>
        >>> firewall = DefaultFirewall()
        >>> firewall.loads(my_picked_data)
        {'list': [1, 2, 'three', b'four']}
        ```
        
        Safely loading PyTorch checkpoint files into numpy arrays is just as easy:
        
        ```python
        >>> from fickle.ext.pytorch import fake_torch_load_zipped
        >>> from zipfile import ZipFile
        >>>
        >>> zf = ZipFile("/path/to/sd-v1-4.ckpt")
        >>> ckpt = fake_torch_load_zipped(zf)
        >>> tensor = ckpt["state_dict"]["model.diffusion_model.output_blocks.3.1.norm.weight"]
        >>> tensor.array
        array([0.39097363, 0.3898967 , 0.35191917, ..., 0.41924757, 0.4031702 ,
               0.37156993], dtype=float32)
        ```
        
        You can, optionally, even use `marshmallow` for validation!
